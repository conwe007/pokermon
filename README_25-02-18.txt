Pokermon

A pokemon clone except each "pokermon" has a unique deck.
    This deck could be standard or could have different amounts of each playing card.

At the start of a battle, each Pokermon draws a five card hand.
    The value of the hand drawn adds special modifiers/effects to the action the pokermon takes.
    ex. a pair doubles damage but halves healing, a flush adds lifesteal, a three of a kind makes the pokermon invulnerable this turn

Pokermon have four types: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds
    Club: High Attack, Low HP
    Spade: High Speed, Low Defense
    Heart: High HP, Low Speed
    Diamond: High Defense, Low Attack

Pokermon are strong/weak against each other depending on type
    Club: Strong against Diamond, Weak against Heart
    Spade: Strong against Heart, Weak against Diamond
    Heart: Strong against Club, Weak against Spade
    Diamond: Strong against Spade, Weak against Club

Pokermon have two stats:
    speed: how likely the pokermon is to go first in battle
    hitpoints: how much damage the pokermon takes

Pokermon can do one of two things on their turn: gamble, cashout
    Gamble: choose up to five cards from hand to redraw
        *players can only gamble up to as many cards are left in the deck
        *if no cards are left in the deck, player must cashout
    Cashout: apply effect of current hand, then draw five cards

Hand Value calculation:
    Each card is assigned a value (2-14) corresponding to its rank
    cards that are the same suit as the pokermon have their value multiplied by 2
    The sum of the five card values including same suit bonus equals the hand value

Cashout mechanics - the following effects can be applied during cashout
    Attack X - deal damage to opponent equal to X * hand value
    Heal X - heal self equal to X * hand value
    Force Draw Random X - randomly select X of the opponent's cards and force them to be redrawn
    Force Draw Target X - manually select X of the opponent's cards and force them to be redrawn
    Lock Random X - randomly select X of the opponent's cards and prevent them from being drawn until they are cashed out
    Lock Target X - manually select X of the opponent's cards and prevent them from being drawn until they are cashed out
    Hold X - manually select X of your own cards to stay in your hand after this cashout (instead of being reshuffled)

When Poker hands are cashed out, they affect the battle as described
    High Card: Attack 1
    Pair: Attack 2
    Two Pair: Heal 2
    Three of a Kind: Attack 3
    Straight: Attack 1, Force Draw Random 1
    Flush: Heal 1, Lock Target 1
    Full House: Attack 2, Heal 1, Hold 1
    Four of a Kind: Attack 4
    Straight Flush: 
    Five of a Kind: 
    Flush House: 
    Flush Five: 

At the beginning of a battle, both pokemon draw. On their turn, they can draw again to reroll their hand.



Each time a pokermon levels up, they can modify their deck by adding/removing cards
    When they level up, three cards are randomly generated. One of the three can be picked to add to the pokemon's deck
    Alternatively, a card in the deck can be removed
    Certain rare items can be consumed to add/remove cards from a pokemon's deck
