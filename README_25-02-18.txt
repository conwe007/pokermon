Pokermon

A pokemon clone except each "pokermon" has a unique deck.
    This deck could be standard or could have different amounts of each playing card.

At the start of a battle, each Pokermon draws a five card hand.
    The value of the hand drawn adds special modifiers/effects to the action the pokermon takes.
    ex. a pair doubles damage but halves healing, a flush adds lifesteal, a three of a kind makes the pokermon invulnerable this turn

Pokermon have four types: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds
    Club: High Attack, Low HP
    Spade: High Speed, Low Defense
    Heart: High HP, Low Speed
    Diamond: High Defense, Low Attack

Pokermon are strong/weak against each other depending on type
    Club: Strong against Diamond, Weak against Heart
    Spade: Strong against Heart, Weak against Diamond
    Heart: Strong against Club, Weak against Spade
    Diamond: Strong against Spade, Weak against Club

Pokermon do not have stats

Pokermon can do one of two things on their turn: gamble, cashout
    Gamble: choose up to five cards from hand to redraw
        *players can only gamble up to as many cards are left in the deck
        *if no cards are left in the deck, player must cashout
    Cashout: apply effect of current hand, then draw five cards

Damage calculation:
    damage = ((attacker_attack / defender_defense) + 2) * type_effectiveness * same_type_bonus
    type_effectiveness = 1.1 when (attacker == club and defender == diamond) or 
                                (attacker == spade and defender == heart) or 
                                (attacker == heart and defender == club) or 
                                (attacker == diamond and defender == spade)
    type_effectiveness = 0.9 when (attacker == club and defender == heart) or 
                                (attacker == spade and defender == diamond) or 
                                (attacker == heart and defender == spade) or 
                                (attacker == diamond and defender == club)
    type_effectiveness = 1 otherwise

When Poker hands are applied, they affect the battle as described
    High Card: attack opponent (damage = sum of card values)
    Pair: attack opponent (damage = 2 * sum of card values)
    Two Pair: 
    Three of a Kind: 
    Straight: 
    Flush: 
    Full House: 
    Four of a Kind: 
    Straight Flush: 

At the beginning of a battle, both pokemon draw. On their turn, they can draw again to reroll their hand.



Each time a pokermon levels up, they can modify their deck by adding/removing cards
    When they level up, three cards are randomly generated. One of the three can be picked to add to the pokemon's deck
    Alternatively, a card in the deck can be removed
    Certain rare items can be consumed to add/remove cards from a pokemon's deck
