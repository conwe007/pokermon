Pokermon

A pokemon clone except each "pokermon" has a unique deck.
    This deck could be standard or could have different amounts of each playing card.

At the start of a battle, each Pokermon draws a five card hand.
    The value of the hand drawn adds special modifiers/effects to the action the pokermon takes.
    ex. a pair doubles damage but halves healing, a flush adds lifesteal, a three of a kind makes the pokermon invulnerable this turn

Pokermon have four types: clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds
    Club: High Attack, Low HP
    Spade: High Speed, Low Defense
    Heart: High HP, Low Speed
    Diamond: High Defense, Low Attack

Pokermon are strong/weak against each other depending on type
    Club: Strong against Diamond, Weak against Heart
    Spade: Strong against Heart, Weak against Diamond
    Heart: Strong against Club, Weak against Spade
    Diamond: Strong against Spade, Weak against Club

Pokermon have the following stats:
    attack: how much damage the pokermon does
    defense: how much damage the pokermon resists
    speed: how likely the pokermon is to go first in battle
    hitpoints: how much damage the pokermon takes

Pokermon can do one of five things on their turn: attack, defend, draw, special, switch, and flee
    Attack: attack the other Pokermon
    Defend: defend against an attack
    Draw: Draw for a new poker hand
    Special: use special move (unique to Pokermon species)
    Switch: switch with another available pokermon

Damage calculation:
    damage = ((attacker_attack / defender_defense) + 2) * type_effectiveness
    type_effectiveness = 1.1 when (attacker == club and defender == diamond) or 
                                (attacker == spade and defender == heart) or 
                                (attacker == heart and defender == club) or 
                                (attacker == diamond and defender == spade)
    type_effectiveness = 0.9 when (attacker == club and defender == heart) or 
                                (attacker == spade and defender == diamond) or 
                                (attacker == heart and defender == spade) or 
                                (attacker == diamond and defender == club)
    type_effectiveness = 1 otherwise

Poker hands give benefits to the actions Pokermon take
    High Card: increase defense by 10%
    Pair: double type strengths/weaknesses
    Two Pair: apply special twice
    Three of a Kind: increase defense by 30% and reflect 50% of damage taken back to attacker
    Straight: always go first
    Flush: cannot be killed in one hit (only will die when attacked at 1 HP)
    Full House: increase attack by 20% and heal by 50% of damage done
    Four of a Kind: increase attack by 50%
    Straight Flush: increase attack and defense by 20%, relfect 30% of damage taken back to attacker, heal 30% of damage done

At the beginning of a battle, both pokemon draw. On their turn, they can draw again to reroll their hand.



Each time a pokermon levels up, they can modify their deck by adding/removing cards
    When they level up, three cards are randomly generated. One of the three can be picked to add to the pokemon's deck
    Alternatively, a card in the deck can be removed
    Certain rare items can be consumed to add/remove cards from a pokemon's deck
